# Enable two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication is used to send an SMS verification code during the logon of a local user. The SMS verification code is used to authenticate the identity of the user for the second time. This reduces the security risks caused by account information leakage. This topic describes how to enable two-factor authentication.

After you enable SMS-based two-factor authentication, the local users who have not bound their mobile numbers cannot perform O&M operations. We recommend that you add the mobile numbers of the local users who need to perform O&M operations before you enable two-factor authentication.
